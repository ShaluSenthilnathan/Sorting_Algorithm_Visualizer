# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualizer

This is a dynamic sorting algorithm visualizer implemented in C using OpenGL (GLUT). It allows you to visualize the working of various sorting algorithms in real-time. The program randomly generates an array of numbers represented as bars with different heights, and then sorts them in ascending order based on the selected sorting algorithm.

## Requirements
C compiler
OpenGL library
GLUT library

## Sorting Algorithms
The program currently supports the following sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Ripple Sort
You can choose between these algorithms by pressing the "c" key.

## Visualization
The bars represent the numbers to be sorted, with their heights indicating their values.
The algorithm being executed is displayed at the top of the window.
During the sorting process, the program highlights the bars being compared and swapped.

## Usage
Press Enter to start the program.
Press "s" to start the sorting process.
Press "c" to select a different sorting algorithm.
Press "r" to randomize the array of numbers.
Press "p" to pause the sorting process.
Press Esc to quit the program.

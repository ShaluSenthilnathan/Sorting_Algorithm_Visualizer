# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualizer

This is a dynamic sorting algorithm visualizer implemented in C using OpenGL (GLUT). It allows users to visualize the working of various sorting algorithms in real-time. The program randomly generates an array of numbers represented as bars with different heights, and then sorts them in ascending order based on the selected sorting algorithm.

## Requirements
C compiler <br />
OpenGL library <br />
GLUT library <br />

## Sorting Algorithms
The program currently supports the following sorting algorithms: <br />
1. Bubble Sort <br />
2. Insertion Sort <br />
3. Selection Sort <br />
4. Ripple Sort <br />

## Visualization
The bars represent the numbers to be sorted, with their heights indicating their values.During the sorting process, the program highlights the bars being compared and swapped.

## Usage
Press Enter to start the program. <br />
Press "s" to start the sorting process. <br />
Press "c" to select a different sorting algorithm.  <br />
Press "r" to randomize the array of numbers. <br />
Press "p" to pause the sorting process. <br />
Press Esc to quit the program. <br />
